# Stepper Motors


##The first mode of operation is Full-step mode

Only one winding of the four is acivated at a time in this mode. Therefore the motor will turn 90 degrees per step- and there are four possible orientations. The orientations are aligned with the windings.

Angular velocity:

##Double-step mode

Two windings are activated at once so the rotor aligns between two on each step. The angular resolution is still the same- there are 4 possible alignments.

Agular velocity:

##Half-step mode

Alternates between two windings and one winding active- effectively combining full-step and double-step. Now there is twice the angular resolution- 8 possible orientations and 45 degrees between each.

Angular velocity:

##Micro-step

In microstep mode, the current provides sine waveform to the windings. This results in many small steps allowing for much greater angular resolution, and so smoother operation.
